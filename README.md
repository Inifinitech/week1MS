Prerequisites: 

1. Used JavaScript to wire down the solution.

#Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Writes a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

 #assign1.js
Upon pressing the button the user is prompted to enter the marks
The function then interpretes the marks entered into a corresponding grade


Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Writes a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

 #assing2.js
When the user presses the button he is prompted to enter the speed of a vehicle
The function adds demerits points for the driver and notifies of license suspension when he reaches 12 points
